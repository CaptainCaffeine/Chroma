#Chroma

Chroma is a WIP Game Boy [Color] emulator written in C++. It has currently only been tested on Linux, however support for other operating systems is planned. At the moment, Chroma does not run any commercial games. 

Chroma is licensed under the GPLv3.

###Building
A reasonably recent compiler is required to build Chroma (at least GCC 5.x or Clang 3.4).

`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake ..`
`make`
